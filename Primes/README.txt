Problem 1: Given one million randomly generated integers, return the total number prime.

testprimes.txt is a text file, comprised of one million randomly generated integers in range [2, 10 ^ 6] separated by newline.

The method for checking primes will be brute force primality testing WITHOUT the use of dynamic programming.
True number of primes: 78,487
